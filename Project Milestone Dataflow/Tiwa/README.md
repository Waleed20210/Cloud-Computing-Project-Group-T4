# Milestone 2: Data Processing Service (Dataflow)


## Objective:
1. Get familiar with Dataflow.
2. Understand MapReduce patterns.
3. Run batch and Stream Processing examples over MNIST dataset.

## Dataflow and a Simple Map Reduce Example:
In this section, you will learn about Dataflow, MapReduce pattern, and a word count as a MapReduce example.
1. Watch this video about [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KalJ0VuEM7s](Google Cloud Dataflow).

## Short Project Description
There are commercial benefits to analyzing and predicting the movements of vehicles and pedestrians around various transportation locations. Such locations are included but not limited to highways, intersections, and roundabouts. By implementing stream processing for predicting vehicle speeds at highways, our application can help improve the accuracy and reliability of traffic speed predictions. This can be a very beneficial tool that can be utilized when enforcing speed limits, alleviating congestion and traffic during peak traffic hours and getting an idea of road patterns based on time and other factors. We aim to utilize various tools and techniques learned throughout the duration of the semester to implement this project.
